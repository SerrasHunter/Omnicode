## There really isn't a whole lot of setup for this. For each class, choose which Combat Routine you would like to default to when changing to that class. Switcharoo will then automatically select that class for you on class change, bypassing the Routine Selection window, and preventing the botbase from pausing whatever activity it was performing.
